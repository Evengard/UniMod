LuaJIT is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for the Lua programming language.

  Lua is a powerful, light-weight programming language designed
  for extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a
  general-purpose, stand-alone language. More information about
  Lua can be found in the docs (see below) or at: http://www.lua.org/

LuaJIT 1.x is based on the Lua 5.1.x virtual machine and bytecode
interpreter from lua.org. It compiles bytecode to native x86 (i386+)
machine code to speed up the execution of Lua programs.
