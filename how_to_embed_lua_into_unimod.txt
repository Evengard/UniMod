For embedding lua files into unimod:
1. run "xxd -i embedded.lua > embedded.h"
2. include "embedded.h" into the "lua_addons.cpp" file where "Include converted lua files" is
3. if you want to run the file at the initialization, insert in the "lua_addons.cpp" file in the "luaAddonsLoad()" function: "runEmbeddedLuaFile(embedded_lua, embedded_lua_len, "embedded.lua");"
4. if you want to register the file as a module instead of running it, insert in the "lua_addons.cpp" file in the "luaAddonsLoad()" function: "registerLuaModule(embedded_lua, embedded_lua_len, "embeddedmodulename");
